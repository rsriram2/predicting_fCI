# Predicting Future Cognitive Impairment (fCI)

## Overview

Predicting Future Cognitive Impairment (fCI) is a project focused on utilizing MRI scan data to predict cognitive impairment in individuals. By implementing a sophisticated data pre-processing pipeline and evaluating various neural network architectures, we aim to develop accurate predictive models. Our work includes transitioning from 2D to 3D models and improving our methodologies to enhance prediction accuracy.
